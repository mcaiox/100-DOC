# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've setup a Notion system for the 100 days of code and completed seven sections of Section 1 - Front-End Web Development from the course on Udemy : The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp (WDBC). I used a cornell note taking system on Notion to make notes. Topics covered include - Syllabus, How to get the most out of this course, 12 rules to learn to code eBook, How the internet works, how websites actually work and setting up machine for web development.

**Thoughts** I've started this challenge after quite some time, so I believe the amount of work will increase as I become more accustomed to working daily.

### Day 2: Tuesday November 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've completed section 1 of (WDBC) and done a few sections on section 2 which covers html. Also, added some useful plugins for VSCode. Found a really useful tool/website for documentation called DevDocs.io . I also review my codebase for my customer support application, mainly the backend.

**Thoughts** I could do more!

### Day 3: Wednesday November 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I began working on requirements for my Customer Support Application. I then worked on a Todo Web Api[3] which is linked below to better my understanding of ASP.NET Core. Additionally, I worked through section 2 of WDBC and my work can be seen below [2]

**Thoughts** The Microsoft Documentation for ASP.Net Core is pretty detailed and I want to go over everything someday!

**Today's Progress**: I worked on learning more C# and used the official documentation/guides. In addition to this, I did some Interview Prep.

**Thoughts** Should do more work!
