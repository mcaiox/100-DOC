# 100 Days Of Learning

This was inspired by 100 Days of Code, however this will be a broader learning log involving learning in different fields involving Meta-learning, Reading, Investing, Arabic, Mobile Application development, Web Development, General Programming and Software Engineering. This list is not restricted to the aforementioned areas.

### Day 1: Friday January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
- Did some reading and research for Investments, primarily on the Electric Vehicle industry and Mining Industry. 
- Worked on setting up React Native Expo project for a Tesla Mobile Application clone.

**Thoughts** : 
- Interesting to look at the supply chain for batteries and companies involved in gathering the raw materials. The EV market is expected to grow rapidly in the next 5 years.
